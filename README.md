# Facial landmark frontalization for DLIB
Simple function to **frontalize** non-frontal 2D facial landmarks, generated by the **DLIB** library.


![demo](data/demo.gif "demo")


# Usage
The function should work directly "out of the box". Frontalization weighs have been learnt and are provided. However, there is also training code in order to retrain with your own data, if needed. 
1. Detect faces and landmarks using DLIB.
2. Pass the landmarks object to the frontalization function ```frontalize_landmarks(landmarks, frontalization weights)```
3. Get back a numpy array of the frontalized landmarks.
